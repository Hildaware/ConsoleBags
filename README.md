Categories
- Based on Item.ClassID (SubClassID is too fine grained)


Data Storage (Cross character, etc.)
- I think we can get away with storing just itemID > link, stackCount, bound
    - ```
        {
            itemId = { link, stackCount, bound }
        }
    ```

TODO BEFORE PUB RELEASE
- Ability to split stacks
- Bag Display
- Money Display
- Switch to 'WoW' view
- Close Button


Category Grouping
- For this to work, we'll have to sort >>> then group
