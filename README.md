Data Storage (Cross character, etc.)
- I think we can get away with storing just itemID > link, stackCount, bound
    - ```
        {
            itemId = { link, stackCount, bound }
        }
    ```

BUGS:
- Equipping bag update?
- Pets in cages have no icon
- Cooldowns are not cool
- Add missing category icons (keys, etc?)

Tech Debt TODOS:
- InventoryFrame & BankFrame are almost identical
