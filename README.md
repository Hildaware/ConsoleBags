Data Storage (Cross character, etc.)
- I think we can get away with storing just itemID > link, stackCount, bound
    - ```
        {
            itemId = { link, stackCount, bound }
        }
    ```

TODO BEFORE PUB RELEASE
- Bag Display
- Switch to 'WoW' view
- wtf is a Reagent bag?

Bugs:
- Frame strata UP

Feats:
- Tooltips (name + num items, maybe NEW items count as well)
- Icon on 'filters' showing if new item in it
- Cat headers need highlight tex
